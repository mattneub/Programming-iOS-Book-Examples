These are the **complete downloadable code examples** for my books, _iOS 14 Programming Fundamentals With Swift_ (<https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/ios-14-programming/9781492092087/>) and _Programming iOS 14_ (<https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-ios-14/9781492092162/>).

Examples have been revised for Xcode 12, Swift 5.3, and iOS 14.

If you find these examples helpful and you haven't purchased the books, please consider doing so.

The downloadable code for the previous editions back through iOS 9 has been moved off to subfolders and zip files. The code for the earlier editions has been removed.
